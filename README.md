# **GIVENCHY BY MATTHEW M. WILLIAMS**

## Project Description

The "Givenchy by Matthew M. Williams" project is implemented as a single-page adaptive website that showcases the spring summer 2021 collection with quotes from Matthew M. Williams and beautiful collection photographs for inspiration.

## Technologies Used in the Project
* An adaptive webpage was created, meaning the website behaves differently on different screen resolutions.
* The SASS preprocessor was used for styling, including working with mixins and variables.
* User interaction with the page is implemented using JavaScript.
* Webpack, Babel.js, Postcss
* Deployment with gh-pages
